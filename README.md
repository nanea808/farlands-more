# Farlands More
A Minecraft SMP for the ages. This repo contains the server files for our most recent Minecraft SMP adventure.
# Rules
- This server is not meant to be a one and done, please don't grind out everything in a day. We want this server to last awhile before we move onto the next season. We are here to have fun, roleplay, tell a story, and have goals outside "who can get end game gear first."
- On the topic of roleplay, it's not required so don't feel obligated to! Some of us will be playing characters and being silly but not everyone has to.
- Each season will be about telling a story and working on goals that get increasing bigger. Everyone has a place, if you want to be a villain, be a villain. If you want to run for mayor, run for mayor. Tell a story, set goals related to that story (think like hermitcraft if you are familiar). As for goals they will start small, and increasingly get bigger the more time we dedicate to playing on the server. There will be events like traveling to the end, or something small like an arena. And at the end of every season we will have one major event to build up to the next season.
- Basic Minecraft Rules are basically don't meta game, and don't be a dick. Don't ruin the experience for others please.
